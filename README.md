# Fishgaman

Fishgaman is an web automation based project aimed to solve the problem of having to check non-trivial stuff repeatitively. Using fishgaman, we can automate the boring and error process so that the information you need is always at reach. As of now, it regularly checks my internet credit info and shows them on my desktop. No need to login, wait and then read. It's at the corner of my screen and I check it for a split second whenever I want. 

##Why fishgaman?

This goes back to the reason I started this project. My ISP, Pishgaman tose-e ertebatat, is not well known for it's high quality service and I as a customer, usually don't have many options to choose. So pretty much, I'm stuck with them and as long as I'm stuck with them, I have to deal with internet data caps. But why automate something as simple as checking your internet plan. To that I'll say, becuase it's no simple task to check your internet plan up to 14 times a day manually and thus, I never did it. As a result, I had no history of my internet usage and no recent detail on my internet plan. How else would I investigate why my monthly internet plan was terminated due to data cap just days after renewing it. So now you have a good idea of why I had to fish for my internet plan info on pishgaman's website, hence the name fishgaman.
